#Tine 2.0 - Professional Open Source Groupware and CRM

* Tine 2.0 is an open source project which combines groupware and CRM in one consistent interface. 

* Tine 2.0 is web-based and optimizes collaboration and organisation of groups in a lasting manner.

* Tine 2.0 unites all the advantages of open source software with an extraordinarily high level of usability and an 
equally high standard of professional software development.

...This is what makes the difference between Tine 2.0 and many other existing groupware solutions.

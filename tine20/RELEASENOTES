GENERAL CHANGES
---

* PHP 7.2 Support

* AreaLocks
It is possible to define protection for certain areas of Tine 2.0. For example, it might be required to give a PIN if you
 want to access the Sales application.

 Example configuration of a Sales app AreaLock with PIN:

     'userPin' => true,
     'areaLocks' => [
         'records' => [
             [
                 'area' => 'Sales',
                 'provider' => 'Pin',
                 'validity' => 'session', // it is only required to give the pin once per session
             ]
         ]
     ],

* Sentry.io integration
If you have a sentry.io server which collects your errors, you can just add it to Tine 2.0 by setting this config:

    'sentryUri' => 'https://USER:PW@sentry.my.domain/2', // note: no double slashes in uri except after "https:"
